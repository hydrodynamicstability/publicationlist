- C. Tong, 2019:  [Statistical inference enables bad science; statistical thinking enables good science](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2018.1518264).  *The American Statistician*, **73** (Sup 1): 246-261.  

  - Published in the special issue on *Statistical Inference in the 21st Century: A World Beyond p < 0.05*.
  
  - Discussed on Andrew Gelman's blog, *Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science* [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/16/harking-sharking-tharking/) and especially [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/17/statistical-inference-enables-bad-science-statistical-thinking-enables-good-science/).  After expressing some concerns, he writes:  "Overall, though, I agree with Tongâ€™s message, and I think everybody should read his article."

  - [R. Picard and D. Osthus (2022)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.22274494v1) call this paper "an insightful historical review of overconfident statistical inference."  This paper has also been cited by a few other statisticians such as [Yihui Xue (2019)](https://slides.yihui.org/2019-ISU-mental.html#43) and [Sander Greenland (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/sjos.12645), though the latter misspelled my name as "Toh".  However most of this paper's citations (as I intended and hoped) are by non-statisticians.
