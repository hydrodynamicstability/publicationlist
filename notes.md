These listings are my no means complete.  Notable examples of omitted items include:

- Contributions to the newsletters of 
  - Nevada Chapter of the American Statistical Assocation (*Silver State-istics*, 2017-2022)
  - American Statistical Association's Council of Chapters Governing Board (*Chapter Chatter*, 2021)
  - Mathematical Assocation of America's Special Interest Group on Mathematics in Business, Industry and Government (*The BIG Notebook*, 2007-2010).

- Presentations at the Animal Biologics Statisticians (2010-2012) and the New Jersey Section of the Mathematical Association of America (2003-2009).

- Academic department seminars/colloquia and class guest lectures.

- Publicly available regulatory documents.

- Nonpublic presentations such as those to the Animal Health Institute's Veterinary Biologics Section.

Other sites maintain even less complete and less accurate lists of my scholarly contributions.  My [Academia.edu profile](http://independent.academia.edu/ChristopherTong) hosts a few statistics publications posted by me; my [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Tong) hosts several papers posted by my co-authors.  Other lists of my publications include:

- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TKoJwycAAAAJ&hl=en).

- [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/2874573/christopher-tong/).  ResearcherID:  A-5761-2009.

- [Dimensions](https://app.dimensions.ai/details/entities/publication/author/ur.014115160135.43).

Finally, note that I have two MR Author IDs on [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/):  644600 and 969588.
