# Additional Notes

These listings are my no means complete.  Notable examples of omitted items include:

- Contributions to the newsletters of the Nevada Chapter of the American Statistical Assocation (2017-present), and the Mathematical Assocation of America's Special Interest Group on Mathematics in Business, Industry and Government (2007-2010).

- Presentations at the Animal Biologics Statisticians (2010-2012) and the New Jersey Section of the Mathematical Association of America (2003-2009).

- Academic department seminars/colloquia and class guest lectures.

- Publicly available regulatory documents.

Other sites maintain even less complete and less accurate lists of my scholarly contributions.
