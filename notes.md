- Presentations at the Animal Biologics Statisticians (2010-2012) and the New Jersey Section of the Mathematical Association of America (2003-2009).

- Academic department seminars/colloquia and class guest lectures.

- Publicly available regulatory documents.

- Nonpublic presentations such as those to the Animal Health Institute's Veterinary Biologics Section, or the Institute for International Cooperation in Animal Biologics.

Other sites maintain even less complete and less accurate lists of my scholarly contributions.  My [Academia.edu profile](http://independent.academia.edu/ChristopherTong) hosts a few statistics publications posted by me; my [ResearchGate profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Tong) hosts several papers posted by my co-authors.  Other lists of my publications include:

- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TKoJwycAAAAJ&hl=en).

- [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/1324289).  ResearcherID:  A-5761-2009.

Finally, note that I have two MR Author IDs on [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/):  644600 and 969588.

# Peer Review activity

In addition to occasional internal peer review service for my employers, I have served as a peer reviewer for the following journals:
